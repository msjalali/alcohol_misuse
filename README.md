# alcohol_misuse

The zip file includes a Vensim file along with two data files. 

The Vensim file includes four views: main view, treatment, model analysis, and optimization setup.

To run the model, these two data files should be in the same folder (directory) as the model file:
1) Estimated parameters through calibration are called from file 'Estimated_parameters_through_calibration.out'
2) External data (historical data) are called from file 'External_data.vdfx'
  
  
  Online model interface is available here: https://mj-lab.mgh.harvard.edu/alcohol-misuse-model
